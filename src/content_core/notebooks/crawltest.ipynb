They\\n\\n3\\n00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,679\\nhave to sell a quantity of debt that the\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,160\\nworld is not going to want to buy. And\\n\\n5\\n00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,400\\nthat's a set of circumstances that is\\n\\n6\\n00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720\\nimminent. It's like being on a ship\\n\\n7\\n00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,199\\nthat's headed to rocks. The credit\\n\\n8\\n00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,680\\nagency Moody's recently downgraded the\\n\\n9\\n00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,320\\nUS government's credit rating from AAA\\n\\n10\\n00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240\\nto double A1. And the timing of this\\n\\n11\\n00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160\\nreally couldn't be worse. The US\\n\\n12\\n00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,160\\ngovernment's 30-year bond yield has\\n\\n13\\n00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800\\nalready been inching towards new highs\\n\\n14\\n00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880\\nthat have not been seen in over 18\\n\\n15\\n00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,559\\nyears. At the same time, the new tax\\n\\n16\\n00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,960\\nbill that just passed is going to be\\n\\n17\\n00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,360\\nwidening the US budget deficit, which is\\n\\n18\\n00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520\\nonly going to add fuel to the fire,\\n\\n19\\n00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,600\\npotentially pushing US bond yields to\\n\\n20\\n00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,480\\nmuch higher levels. If US government\\n\\n21\\n00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,719\\nbond yields keep climbing, it will have\\n\\n22\\n00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,960\\ndevastating impacts on the US economy.\\n\\n23\\n00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039\\nGovernment bond yields are a benchmark\\n\\n24\\n00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,120\\nfor all other interest rates around the\\n\\n25\\n00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,440\\neconomy, from mortgage rates, so setting\\n\\n26\\n00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,359\\nthe price to buy a home, to corporate\\n\\n27\\n00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,199\\nborrowing costs. But is there really\\n\\n28\\n00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040\\nnothing that the US government can do to\\n\\n29\\n00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,479\\nprevent this kind of debt crisis from\\n\\n30\\n00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960\\nunfolding? Well, as I'm going to show\\n\\n31\\n00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,880\\nyou in this video, there is one sneaky\\n\\n32\\n00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,479\\ntrick that authorities do have up their\\n\\n33\\n00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,760\\nsleeves to make sure that none of this\\n\\n34\\n00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,920\\nhappens. So, I'm going to show you\\n\\n35\\n00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,360\\nexactly what that is in this video and\\n\\n36\\n00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960\\nwhether we should expect them to\\n\\n37\\n00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,119\\nactually use it to prevent government\\n\\n38\\n00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,880\\nbond yields from rising uncontrollably.\\n\\n39\\n00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,240\\nThe US national debt is nearing $ 37\\n\\n40\\n00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,000\\ntrillion with interest payments on the\\n\\n41\\n00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,079\\ndebt alone approaching 4.6% of GDP, the\\n\\n42\\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640\\nhighest among developed economies. And\\n\\n43\\n00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,280\\ndespite this, the US continues to run a\\n\\n44\\n00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,759\\nwide budget deficit. And now comes what\\n\\n45\\n00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840\\nlawmakers are calling the big beautiful\\n\\n46\\n00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,920\\nbill. A new tax proposal that is\\n\\n47\\n00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,479\\nprojected to widen the deficit even\\n\\n48\\n00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280\\nfurther, signaling even greater Treasury\\n\\n49\\n00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,439\\nbond issuance ahead, potentially causing\\n\\n50\\n00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360\\ngreater upwards pressure on government\\n\\n51\\n00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,399\\nbond yields. You see, when investors\\n\\n52\\n00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,399\\nperceive more risk, they demand a higher\\n\\n53\\n00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,719\\ninterest rate to compensate for this\\n\\n54\\n00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,960\\nrisk. That's how credit markets work.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,280\\nThink about a company issuing debt. If\\n\\n56\\n00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,280\\nit's a stable, profitable business, it's\\n\\n57\\n00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959\\nmuch more likely to get a low interest\\n\\n58\\n00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640\\nrate on the debt that it's borrowing.\\n\\n59\\n00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,040\\nBut if investors perceive the business\\n\\n60\\n00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640\\nto be a high-risk investment, they will\\n\\n61\\n00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,400\\nwant a higher interest rate to\\n\\n62\\n00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800\\ncompensate for the risk of owning the\\n\\n63\\n00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,520\\ndebt of a higher risk company. And the\\n\\n64\\n00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360\\nexact same logic can be applied to the\\n\\n65\\n00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200\\ngovernment. If investors perceive that\\n\\n66\\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,959\\nthe government is spending recklessly\\n\\n67\\n00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400\\nand might not be able to pay its debt\\n\\n68\\n00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,319\\nback, well, they're going to demand a\\n\\n69\\n00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,160\\nhigher interest rate on that debt. And\\n\\n70\\n00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,560\\nthat is exactly what's happening. But\\n\\n71\\n00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,360\\nthere is one big caveat to all of this.\\n\\n72\\n00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,440\\nHowever, unlike corporations, the US\\n\\n73\\n00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840\\ngovernment issues debt in its own\\n\\n74\\n00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,080\\ncurrency. That is the US dollar. And the\\n\\n75\\n00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000\\nFederal Reserve has the power to print\\n\\n76\\n00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160\\nUS dollars. That is certainly not the\\n\\n77\\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,160\\ncase for a typical business. So why is\\n\\n78\\n00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,080\\nthe Fed not just printing money right\\n\\n79\\n00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,760\\nnow to pay back all of the government's\\n\\n80\\n00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680\\ndebt, which would avoid interest rates\\n\\n81\\n00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440\\nfrom rising and avoid all of the\\n\\n82\\n00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,599\\neconomic damage that would come as a\\n\\n83\\n00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,000\\nresult? Now, this is not conspiracy\\n\\n84\\n00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,680\\ntheory. It's entirely plausible and it's\\n\\n85\\n00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080\\nalready happened before. This is a\\n\\n86\\n00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200\\nmechanism called quantitative easing and\\n\\n87\\n00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360\\nit's when the Federal Reserve\\n\\n88\\n00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,599\\nessentially prints US dollars in order\\n\\n89\\n00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,000\\nto purchase the US government's debt.\\n\\n90\\n00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,239\\nNow, this doesn't pay the debt back, but\\n\\n91\\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080\\nit can artificially lower interest\\n\\n92\\n00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920\\nrates, making it easier for the\\n\\n93\\n00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480\\ngovernment to pay its debt back. The\\n\\n94\\n00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,040\\nFederal Reserve used this in 2008 during\\n\\n95\\n00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360\\nthe great financial crisis and again in\\n\\n96\\n00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,680\\n2020. Both of these times had helped\\n\\n97\\n00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,000\\nstabilize the bond market and lower\\n\\n98\\n00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080\\ngovernment bond yields to help stimulate\\n\\n99\\n00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,400\\neconomic growth. Question now is whether\\n\\n100\\n00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,799\\nwe should expect them to do this now as\\n\\n101\\n00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200\\ninterest rates are inching to 18-year\\n\\n102\\n00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720\\nhighs. So, let's break it down. The line\\n\\n103\\n00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,799\\nthat you see here is the Federal\\n\\n104\\n00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640\\nReserve's balance sheet. Just like a\\n\\n105\\n00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,200\\ncompany's balance sheet, it represents\\n\\n106\\n00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,599\\nthe total value of assets held by the\\n\\n107\\n00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,760\\nFederal Reserve updated every week on\\n\\n108\\n00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,840\\nWednesday. This balance sheet includes\\n\\n109\\n00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920\\nassets like US treasuries,\\n\\n110\\n00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,959\\nmortgagebacked securities, foreign\\n\\n111\\n00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,519\\ncurrency reserves, gold, emergency loans\\n\\n112\\n00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,080\\nto financial institutions. But by far\\n\\n113\\n00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,799\\nthe largest share of these assets is\\n\\n114\\n00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,040\\nheld in the form of US Treasury bonds.\\n\\n115\\n00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,799\\nSo when the Fed's balance sheet expands\\n\\n116\\n00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,280\\nlike it did in 2008, 2011, and 2020, it\\n\\n117\\n00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,680\\nmeans the Fed is buying treasuries by\\n\\n118\\n00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,240\\ncreating new dollars. And this directly\\n\\n119\\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,400\\nhelps to lower bond yields which in turn\\n\\n120\\n00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639\\nlowers borrowing cost, supports economic\\n\\n121\\n00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080\\ngrowth and stabilizes financial markets\\n\\n122\\n00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720\\nduring periods of stress like a\\n\\n123\\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800\\nfinancial crisis or a pandemic. This\\n\\n124\\n00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280\\nprocess of expanding their balance sheet\\n\\n125\\n00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199\\nto buy US treasuries is the quantitative\\n\\n126\\n00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,639\\neasing that we mentioned earlier. But if\\n\\n127\\n00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,479\\nwe look at the Fed's balance sheet\\n\\n128\\n00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,160\\ntoday, we see they haven't been doing\\n\\n129\\n00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680\\nquantitative easing. In fact, they've\\n\\n130\\n00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360\\nbeen doing the exact opposite,\\n\\n131\\n00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199\\nquantitative tightening. So, they've\\n\\n132\\n00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120\\nbeen reducing their balance sheet and\\n\\n133\\n00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800\\nactually selling US treasuries, which\\n\\n134\\n00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720\\nhas been putting upwards pressure on\\n\\n135\\n00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,479\\nbond yields. Ever since the Fed began\\n\\n136\\n00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,360\\nshrinking its balance sheet in early\\n\\n137\\n00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,280\\n2022, government bond yields have surged\\n\\n138\\n00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840\\nin a way that we haven't seen since the\\n\\n139\\n00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,680\\n1970s. So, why is the Fed letting this\\n\\n140\\n00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520\\nhappen? Why are they not buying US\\n\\n141\\n00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360\\ntreasuries to bring interest rates back\\n\\n142\\n00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,600\\ndown? Well, what we have to understand\\n\\n143\\n00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,840\\nis that everything the Fed does ties\\n\\n144\\n00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,240\\nback to their dual mandate, stable\\n\\n145\\n00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240\\nprices and maximum employment. In other\\n\\n146\\n00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320\\nwords, keeping inflation low and\\n\\n147\\n00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,680\\navoiding layoffs. Let's start by looking\\n\\n148\\n00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,520\\nat inflation. In both 2008 and 2020,\\n\\n149\\n00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120\\ninflation was collapsing as a result of\\n\\n150\\n00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280\\nthe great financial crisis and the\\n\\n151\\n00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520\\npandemic. This gave the Fed plenty of\\n\\n152\\n00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440\\nroom to print new dollars and inject\\n\\n153\\n00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,000\\nliquidity into the system. Quantitative\\n\\n154\\n00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,360\\neasing made sense. But after 2020,\\n\\n155\\n00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,280\\ninflation surged to 9% in June of 2022\\n\\n156\\n00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600\\nas a result of all the liquidity that\\n\\n157\\n00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,840\\nhad been injected. So, the Fed had to\\n\\n158\\n00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,160\\nrespond by pulling liquidity away from\\n\\n159\\n00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,320\\nthe financial system and selling US\\n\\n160\\n00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080\\ntreasuries, raising interest rates. And\\n\\n161\\n00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,160\\nas we can see, that worked. Inflation\\n\\n162\\n00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,160\\nhas come back down significantly, almost\\n\\n163\\n00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160\\nall the way back to the Fed's 2%\\n\\n164\\n00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,600\\ninflation target. So, you might be\\n\\n165\\n00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,440\\nwondering, is this the green light for\\n\\n166\\n00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,360\\nthem to do quantitative easing? Well,\\n\\n167\\n00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,759\\nit's not quite that simple because the\\n\\n168\\n00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,240\\nFed doesn't just look at inflation. They\\n\\n169\\n00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,919\\nlook at inflation expectations. or in\\n\\n170\\n00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160\\nother words, what the market believes\\n\\n171\\n00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,840\\nfuture inflation will look like over the\\n\\n172\\n00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600\\nnext several years. And we can track\\n\\n173\\n00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680\\ninflation expectations through what's\\n\\n174\\n00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,960\\ncalled the 5-year break even inflation\\n\\n175\\n00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639\\nrate. This is one of the Federal\\n\\n176\\n00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479\\nReserve's indicators that measures the\\n\\n177\\n00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,039\\ndifference between the yields of 5-year\\n\\n178\\n00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,280\\nTreasury bonds versus 5-year Treasury\\n\\n179\\n00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,280\\ninflation protected securities. To put\\n\\n180\\n00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520\\nit simply, this basically measures how\\n\\n181\\n00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,600\\nthe bond market is pricing inflation\\n\\n182\\n00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,759\\nover the next 5 years. And historically,\\n\\n183\\n00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400\\nwe've only seen the Federal Reserve do\\n\\n184\\n00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800\\nQE or quantitative easing when inflation\\n\\n185\\n00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,680\\nexpectations are below their target of\\n\\n186\\n00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600\\n2%. Right now, that's not the case. The\\n\\n187\\n00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000\\n5-year break even inflation rate is\\n\\n188\\n00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,080\\nholding steady well above 2%, which is\\n\\n189\\n00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000\\nnot giving them a signal to begin doing\\n\\n190\\n00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,240\\nany kind of quantitative easing. So,\\n\\n191\\n00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,560\\ntheir inflation mandate is not pointing\\n\\n192\\n00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800\\nto QE. But what about their employment\\n\\n193\\n00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240\\nmandate? This is the US unemployment\\n\\n194\\n00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880\\nrate. And according to the Federal\\n\\n195\\n00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,960\\nReserve, they consider that the 4 to 5%\\n\\n196\\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,680\\nrange can be classified as full\\n\\n197\\n00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,520\\nemployment. And so anything above a 5%\\n\\n198\\n00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280\\nunemployment rate means they haven't\\n\\n199\\n00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,560\\nreached their goal of full employment.\\n\\n200\\n00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,000\\nToday, the unemployment rate stands at\\n\\n201\\n00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,080\\n4.2%. So from the labor market's\\n\\n202\\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240\\nperspective, the Federal Reserve has no\\n\\n203\\n00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,560\\nurgent reason to step in right now. So\\n\\n204\\n00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,880\\nfar, neither the inflation nor the\\n\\n205\\n00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479\\nemployment part of the Fed's mandate is\\n\\n206\\n00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,240\\ncurrently pointing to quantitative\\n\\n207\\n00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,080\\neasing, which means in our opinion, the\\n\\n208\\n00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919\\nFed is not going to be stepping in here\\n\\n209\\n00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919\\nto bail out the US government just\\n\\n210\\n00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,479\\nbecause bond yields are rising. If they\\n\\n211\\n00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,240\\ndid do QE just because bond yields were\\n\\n212\\n00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160\\nrising, that would go against the\\n\\n213\\n00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759\\nFederal Reserve's mandate and it would\\n\\n214\\n00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000\\nerode their independence from the\\n\\n215\\n00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680\\ngovernment and investors confidence in\\n\\n216\\n00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680\\nthe Federal Reserve system, something\\n\\n217\\n00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000\\nthey would definitely want to avoid. We\\n\\n218\\n00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,400\\nthink the more plausible path forward is\\n\\n219\\n00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,039\\nthat bond yields remain elevated and\\n\\n220\\n00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,120\\nthat eventually this begins to hurt real\\n\\n221\\n00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,680\\neconomic growth. We saw this kind of\\n\\n222\\n00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,599\\nscenario take place in the 1970s. Back\\n\\n223\\n00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120\\nthen, rapidly rising interest rates\\n\\n224\\n00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,960\\neventually triggered economic\\n\\n225\\n00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039\\nrecessions, as you can see highlighted\\n\\n226\\n00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,199\\nby these gray bars. These were moments\\n\\n227\\n00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,520\\nwhere unemployment in the United States\\n\\n228\\n00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680\\nsurged. It's entirely possible that we\\n\\n229\\n00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,840\\nsee something like this happen today\\n\\n230\\n00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240\\nwhere rising bond yields eventually lead\\n\\n231\\n00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,479\\nto an actual economic slowdown where the\\n\\n232\\n00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319\\nunemployment rate rises and only then\\n\\n233\\n00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,240\\nwould the Federal Reserve react and\\n\\n234\\n00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,919\\nbegin to print money to buy the\\n\\n235\\n00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160\\ngovernment's debt and lower interest\\n\\n236\\n00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,560\\nrates. But until then, we think there's\\n\\n237\\n00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,640\\nlikely more pain ahead in the bond\\n\\n238\\n00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,640\\nmarket.

They have to sell a quantity of debt that the world is not going to want to buy. And that's a set of circumstances that is imminent. It's like being on a ship that's headed to rocks. The credit agency Moody's recently downgraded the US government's credit rating from AAA to double A1. And the timing of this really couldn't be worse. The US government's 30-year bond yield has already been inching towards new highs that have not been seen in over 18 years. At the same time, the new tax bill that just passed is going to be widening the US budget deficit, which is only going to add fuel to the fire, potentially pushing US bond yields to much higher levels. If US government bond yields keep climbing, it will have devastating impacts on the US economy. Government bond yields are a benchmark for all other interest rates around the economy, from mortgage rates, so setting the price to buy a home, to corporate borrowing costs. But is there really nothing that the US government can do to prevent this kind of debt crisis from unfolding? Well, as I'm going to show you in this video, there is one sneaky trick that authorities do have up their sleeves to make sure that none of this happens. So, I'm going to show you exactly what that is in this video and whether we should expect them to actually use it to prevent government bond yields from rising uncontrollably. The US national debt is nearing $ 37 trillion with interest payments on the debt alone approaching 4.6% of GDP, the highest among developed economies. And despite this, the US continues to run a wide budget deficit. And now comes what lawmakers are calling the big beautiful bill. A new tax proposal that is projected to widen the deficit even further, signaling even greater Treasury bond issuance ahead, potentially causing greater upwards pressure on government bond yields. You see, when investors perceive more risk, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate for this risk. That's how credit markets work. Think about a company issuing debt. If it's a stable, profitable business, it's much more likely to get a low interest rate on the debt that it's borrowing. But if investors perceive the business to be a high-risk investment, they will want a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning the debt of a higher risk company. And the exact same logic can be applied to the government. If investors perceive that the government is spending recklessly and might not be able to pay its debt back, well, they're going to demand a higher interest rate on that debt. And that is exactly what's happening. But there is one big caveat to all of this. However, unlike corporations, the US government issues debt in its own currency. That is the US dollar. And the Federal Reserve has the power to print US dollars. That is certainly not the case for a typical business. So why is the Fed not just printing money right now to pay back all of the government's debt, which would avoid interest rates from rising and avoid all of the economic damage that would come as a result? Now, this is not conspiracy theory. It's entirely plausible and it's already happened before. This is a mechanism called quantitative easing and it's when the Federal Reserve essentially prints US dollars in order to purchase the US government's debt. Now, this doesn't pay the debt back, but it can artificially lower interest rates, making it easier for the government to pay its debt back. The Federal Reserve used this in 2008 during the great financial crisis and again in 2020. Both of these times had helped stabilize the bond market and lower government bond yields to help stimulate economic growth. Question now is whether we should expect them to do this now as interest rates are inching to 18-year highs. So, let's break it down. The line that you see here is the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Just like a company's balance sheet, it represents the total value of assets held by the Federal Reserve updated every week on Wednesday. This balance sheet includes assets like US treasuries, mortgagebacked securities, foreign currency reserves, gold, emergency loans to financial institutions. But by far the largest share of these assets is held in the form of US Treasury bonds. So when the Fed's balance sheet expands like it did in 2008, 2011, and 2020, it means the Fed is buying treasuries by creating new dollars. And this directly helps to lower bond yields which in turn lowers borrowing cost, supports economic growth and stabilizes financial markets during periods of stress like a financial crisis or a pandemic. This process of expanding their balance sheet to buy US treasuries is the quantitative easing that we mentioned earlier. But if we look at the Fed's balance sheet today, we see they haven't been doing quantitative easing. In fact, they've been doing the exact opposite, quantitative tightening. So, they've been reducing their balance sheet and actually selling US treasuries, which has been putting upwards pressure on bond yields. Ever since the Fed began shrinking its balance sheet in early 2022, government bond yields have surged in a way that we haven't seen since the 1970s. So, why is the Fed letting this happen? Why are they not buying US treasuries to bring interest rates back down? Well, what we have to understand is that everything the Fed does ties back to their dual mandate, stable prices and maximum employment. In other words, keeping inflation low and avoiding layoffs. Let's start by looking at inflation. In both 2008 and 2020, inflation was collapsing as a result of the great financial crisis and the pandemic. This gave the Fed plenty of room to print new dollars and inject liquidity into the system. Quantitative easing made sense. But after 2020, inflation surged to 9% in June of 2022 as a result of all the liquidity that had been injected. So, the Fed had to respond by pulling liquidity away from the financial system and selling US treasuries, raising interest rates. And as we can see, that worked. Inflation has come back down significantly, almost all the way back to the Fed's 2% inflation target. So, you might be wondering, is this the green light for them to do quantitative easing? Well, it's not quite that simple because the Fed doesn't just look at inflation. They look at inflation expectations. or in other words, what the market believes future inflation will look like over the next several years. And we can track inflation expectations through what's called the 5-year break even inflation rate. This is one of the Federal Reserve's indicators that measures the difference between the yields of 5-year Treasury bonds versus 5-year Treasury inflation protected securities. To put it simply, this basically measures how the bond market is pricing inflation over the next 5 years. And historically, we've only seen the Federal Reserve do QE or quantitative easing when inflation expectations are below their target of 2%. Right now, that's not the case. The 5-year break even inflation rate is holding steady well above 2%, which is not giving them a signal to begin doing any kind of quantitative easing. So, their inflation mandate is not pointing to QE. But what about their employment mandate? This is the US unemployment rate. And according to the Federal Reserve, they consider that the 4 to 5% range can be classified as full employment. And so anything above a 5% unemployment rate means they haven't reached their goal of full employment. Today, the unemployment rate stands at 4.2%. So from the labor market's perspective, the Federal Reserve has no urgent reason to step in right now. So far, neither the inflation nor the employment part of the Fed's mandate is currently pointing to quantitative easing, which means in our opinion, the Fed is not going to be stepping in here to bail out the US government just because bond yields are rising. If they did do QE just because bond yields were rising, that would go against the Federal Reserve's mandate and it would erode their independence from the government and investors confidence in the Federal Reserve system, something they would definitely want to avoid. We think the more plausible path forward is that bond yields remain elevated and that eventually this begins to hurt real economic growth. We saw this kind of scenario take place in the 1970s. Back then, rapidly rising interest rates eventually triggered economic recessions, as you can see highlighted by these gray bars. These were moments where unemployment in the United States surged. It's entirely possible that we see something like this happen today where rising bond yields eventually lead to an actual economic slowdown where the unemployment rate rises and only then would the Federal Reserve react and begin to print money to buy the government's debt and lower interest rates. But until then, we think there's likely more pain ahead in the bond market. Now, although we are bearish on the bond market, we do have exposure to the US stock market today as we think it can remain resilient throughout the rest of 2025. We have exposure to a bunch of stocks that we think can outperform, including Spotify that we're already up 10% on, IBM, NT, KAC, a semiconductor stock, just to name a few. We also have exposure to silver that is up about 10% since we initiated that trade. Our job at Bravos Research is to find opportunities on the market and help you be as profitable as possible.

Well, as I'm going to show\\n\\n31\\n00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,880\\nyou in this video, there is one sneaky\\n\\n32\\n00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,479\\ntrick that authorities do have up their\\n\\n33\\n00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,760\\nsleeves to make sure that none of this\\n\\n34\\n00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,920\\nhappens.

And\\n\\n43\\n00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,280\\ndespite this, the US continues to run a\\n\\n44\\n00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,759\\nwide budget deficit. And now comes what\\n\\n45\\n00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840\\nlawmakers are calling the big beautiful\\n\\n46\\n00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,920\\nbill. A new tax proposal that is\\n\\n47\\n00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,479\\nprojected to widen the deficit even\\n\\n48\\n00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280\\nfurther, signaling even greater Treasury\\n\\n49\\n00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,439\\nbond issuance ahead, potentially causing\\n\\n50\\n00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360\\ngreater upwards pressure on government\\n\\n51\\n00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,399\\nbond yields. You see, when investors\\n\\n52\\n00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,399\\nperceive more risk, they demand a higher\\n\\n53\\n00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,719\\ninterest rate to compensate for this\\n\\n54\\n00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,960\\nrisk. That's how credit markets work.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,280\\nThink about a company issuing debt. If\\n\\n56\\n00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,280\\nit's a stable, profitable business, it's\\n\\n57\\n00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959\\nmuch more likely to get a low interest\\n\\n58\\n00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640\\nrate on the debt that it's borrowing.\\n\\n59\\n00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,040\\nBut if investors perceive the business\\n\\n60\\n00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640\\nto be a high-risk investment, they will\\n\\n61\\n00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,400\\nwant a higher interest rate to\\n\\n62\\n00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800\\ncompensate for the risk of owning the\\n\\n63\\n00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,520\\ndebt of a higher risk company. And the\\n\\n64\\n00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360\\nexact same logic can be applied to the\\n\\n65\\n00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200\\ngovernment. If investors perceive that\\n\\n66\\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,959\\nthe government is spending recklessly\\n\\n67\\n00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400\\nand might not be able to pay its debt\\n\\n68\\n00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,319\\nback, well, they're going to demand a\\n\\n69\\n00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,160\\nhigher interest rate on that debt. And\\n\\n70\\n00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,560\\nthat is exactly what's happening. But\\n\\n71\\n00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,360\\nthere is one big caveat to all of this.\\n\\n72\\n00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,440\\nHowever, unlike corporations, the US\\n\\n73\\n00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840\\ngovernment issues debt in its own\\n\\n74\\n00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,080\\ncurrency. That is the US dollar. And the\\n\\n75\\n00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000\\nFederal Reserve has the power to print\\n\\n76\\n00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160\\nUS dollars. That is certainly not the\\n\\n77\\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,160\\ncase for a typical business. So why is\\n\\n78\\n00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,080\\nthe Fed not just printing money right\\n\\n79\\n00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,760\\nnow to pay back all of the government's\\n\\n80\\n00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680\\ndebt, which would avoid interest rates\\n\\n81\\n00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440\\nfrom rising and avoid all of the\\n\\n82\\n00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,599\\neconomic damage that would come as a\\n\\n83\\n00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,000\\nresult? Now, this is not conspiracy\\n\\n84\\n00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,680\\ntheory. It's entirely plausible and it's\\n\\n85\\n00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080\\nalready happened before. This is a\\n\\n86\\n00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200\\nmechanism called quantitative easing and\\n\\n87\\n00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360\\nit's when the Federal Reserve\\n\\n88\\n00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,599\\nessentially prints US dollars in order\\n\\n89\\n00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,000\\nto purchase the US government's debt.\\n\\n90\\n00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,239\\nNow, this doesn't pay the debt back, but\\n\\n91\\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080\\nit can artificially lower interest\\n\\n92\\n00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920\\nrates, making it easier for the\\n\\n93\\n00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480\\ngovernment to pay its debt back. The\\n\\n94\\n00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,040\\nFederal Reserve used this in 2008 during\\n\\n95\\n00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360\\nthe great financial crisis and again in\\n\\n96\\n00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,680\\n2020. Both of these times had helped\\n\\n97\\n00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,000\\nstabilize the bond market and lower\\n\\n98\\n00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080\\ngovernment bond yields to help stimulate\\n\\n99\\n00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,400\\neconomic growth. Question now is whether\\n\\n100\\n00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,799\\nwe should expect them to do this now as\\n\\n101\\n00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200\\ninterest rates are inching to 18-year\\n\\n102\\n00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720\\nhighs. So, let's break it down. The line\\n\\n103\\n00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,799\\nthat you see here is the Federal\\n\\n104\\n00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640\\nReserve's balance sheet. Just like a\\n\\n105\\n00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,200\\ncompany's balance sheet, it represents\\n\\n106\\n00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,599\\nthe total value of assets held by the\\n\\n107\\n00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,760\\nFederal Reserve updated every week on\\n\\n108\\n00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,840\\nWednesday. This balance sheet includes\\n\\n109\\n00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920\\nassets like US treasuries,\\n\\n110\\n00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,959\\nmortgagebacked securities, foreign\\n\\n111\\n00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,519\\ncurrency reserves, gold, emergency loans\\n\\n112\\n00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,080\\nto financial institutions. But by far\\n\\n113\\n00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,799\\nthe largest share of these assets is\\n\\n114\\n00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,040\\nheld in the form of US Treasury bonds.\\n\\n115\\n00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,799\\nSo when the Fed's balance sheet expands\\n\\n116\\n00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,280\\nlike it did in 2008, 2011, and 2020, it\\n\\n117\\n00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,680\\nmeans the Fed is buying treasuries by\\n\\n118\\n00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,240\\ncreating new dollars. And this directly\\n\\n119\\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,400\\nhelps to lower bond yields which in turn\\n\\n120\\n00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639\\nlowers borrowing cost, supports economic\\n\\n121\\n00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080\\ngrowth and stabilizes financial markets\\n\\n122\\n00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720\\nduring periods of stress like a\\n\\n123\\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800\\nfinancial crisis or a pandemic. This\\n\\n124\\n00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280\\nprocess of expanding their balance sheet\\n\\n125\\n00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199\\nto buy US treasuries is the quantitative\\n\\n126\\n00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,639\\neasing that we mentioned earlier. But if\\n\\n127\\n00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,479\\nwe look at the Fed's balance sheet\\n\\n128\\n00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,160\\ntoday, we see they haven't been doing\\n\\n129\\n00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680\\nquantitative easing. In fact, they've\\n\\n130\\n00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360\\nbeen doing the exact opposite,\\n\\n131\\n00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199\\nquantitative tightening. So, they've\\n\\n132\\n00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120\\nbeen reducing their balance sheet and\\n\\n133\\n00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800\\nactually selling US treasuries, which\\n\\n134\\n00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720\\nhas been putting upwards pressure on\\n\\n135\\n00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,479\\nbond yields. Ever since the Fed began\\n\\n136\\n00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,360\\nshrinking its balance sheet in early\\n\\n137\\n00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,280\\n2022, government bond yields have surged\\n\\n138\\n00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840\\nin a way that we haven't seen since the\\n\\n139\\n00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,680\\n1970s. So, why is the Fed letting this\\n\\n140\\n00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520\\nhappen? Why are they not buying US\\n\\n141\\n00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360\\ntreasuries to bring interest rates back\\n\\n142\\n00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,600\\ndown? Well, what we have to understand\\n\\n143\\n00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,840\\nis that everything the Fed does ties\\n\\n144\\n00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,240\\nback to their dual mandate, stable\\n\\n145\\n00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240\\nprices and maximum employment. In other\\n\\n146\\n00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320\\nwords, keeping inflation low and\\n\\n147\\n00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,680\\navoiding layoffs. Let's start by looking\\n\\n148\\n00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,520\\nat inflation. In both 2008 and 2020,\\n\\n149\\n00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120\\ninflation was collapsing as a result of\\n\\n150\\n00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280\\nthe great financial crisis and the\\n\\n151\\n00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520\\npandemic. This gave the Fed plenty of\\n\\n152\\n00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440\\nroom to print new dollars and inject\\n\\n153\\n00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,000\\nliquidity into the system. Quantitative\\n\\n154\\n00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,360\\neasing made sense. But after 2020,\\n\\n155\\n00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,280\\ninflation surged to 9% in June of 2022\\n\\n156\\n00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600\\nas a result of all the liquidity that\\n\\n157\\n00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,840\\nhad been injected. So, the Fed had to\\n\\n158\\n00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,160\\nrespond by pulling liquidity away from\\n\\n159\\n00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,320\\nthe financial system and selling US\\n\\n160\\n00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080\\ntreasuries, raising interest rates. And\\n\\n161\\n00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,160\\nas we can see, that worked. Inflation\\n\\n162\\n00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,160\\nhas come back down significantly, almost\\n\\n163\\n00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160\\nall the way back to the Fed's 2%\\n\\n164\\n00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,600\\ninflation target. So, you might be\\n\\n165\\n00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,440\\nwondering, is this the green light for\\n\\n166\\n00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,360\\nthem to do quantitative easing? Well,\\n\\n167\\n00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,759\\nit's not quite that simple because the\\n\\n168\\n00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,240\\nFed doesn't just look at inflation. They\\n\\n169\\n00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,919\\nlook at inflation expectations. or in\\n\\n170\\n00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160\\nother words, what the market believes\\n\\n171\\n00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,840\\nfuture inflation will look like over the\\n\\n172\\n00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600\\nnext several years. And we can track\\n\\n173\\n00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680\\ninflation expectations through what's\\n\\n174\\n00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,960\\ncalled the 5-year break even inflation\\n\\n175\\n00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639\\nrate. This is one of the Federal\\n\\n176\\n00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479\\nReserve's indicators that measures the\\n\\n177\\n00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,039\\ndifference between the yields of 5-year\\n\\n178\\n00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,280\\nTreasury bonds versus 5-year Treasury\\n\\n179\\n00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,280\\ninflation protected securities. To put\\n\\n180\\n00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520\\nit simply, this basically measures how\\n\\n181\\n00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,600\\nthe bond market is pricing inflation\\n\\n182\\n00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,759\\nover the next 5 years. And historically,\\n\\n183\\n00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400\\nwe've only seen the Federal Reserve do\\n\\n184\\n00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800\\nQE or quantitative easing when inflation\\n\\n185\\n00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,680\\nexpectations are below their target of\\n\\n186\\n00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600\\n2%. Right now, that's not the case. The\\n\\n187\\n00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000\\n5-year break even inflation rate is\\n\\n188\\n00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,080\\nholding steady well above 2%, which is\\n\\n189\\n00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000\\nnot giving them a signal to begin doing\\n\\n190\\n00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,240\\nany kind of quantitative easing. So,\\n\\n191\\n00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,560\\ntheir inflation mandate is not pointing\\n\\n192\\n00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800\\nto QE. But what about their employment\\n\\n193\\n00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240\\nmandate? This is the US unemployment\\n\\n194\\n00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880\\nrate. And according to the Federal\\n\\n195\\n00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,960\\nReserve, they consider that the 4 to 5%\\n\\n196\\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,680\\nrange can be classified as full\\n\\n197\\n00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,520\\nemployment. And so anything above a 5%\\n\\n198\\n00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280\\nunemployment rate means they haven't\\n\\n199\\n00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,560\\nreached their goal of full employment.\\n\\n200\\n00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,000\\nToday, the unemployment rate stands at\\n\\n201\\n00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,080\\n4.2%. So from the labor market's\\n\\n202\\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240\\nperspective, the Federal Reserve has no\\n\\n203\\n00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,560\\nurgent reason to step in right now. So\\n\\n204\\n00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,880\\nfar, neither the inflation nor the\\n\\n205\\n00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479\\nemployment part of the Fed's mandate is\\n\\n206\\n00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,240\\ncurrently pointing to quantitative\\n\\n207\\n00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,080\\neasing, which means in our opinion, the\\n\\n208\\n00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919\\nFed is not going to be stepping in here\\n\\n209\\n00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919\\nto bail out the US government just\\n\\n210\\n00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,479\\nbecause bond yields are rising. If they\\n\\n211\\n00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,240\\ndid do QE just because bond yields were\\n\\n212\\n00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160\\nrising, that would go against the\\n\\n213\\n00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759\\nFederal Reserve's mandate and it would\\n\\n214\\n00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000\\nerode their independence from the\\n\\n215\\n00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680\\ngovernment and investors confidence in\\n\\n216\\n00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680\\nthe Federal Reserve system, something\\n\\n217\\n00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000\\nthey would definitely want to avoid. We\\n\\n218\\n00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,400\\nthink the more plausible path forward is\\n\\n219\\n00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,039\\nthat bond yields remain elevated and\\n\\n220\\n00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,120\\nthat eventually this begins to hurt real\\n\\n221\\n00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,680\\neconomic growth. We saw this kind of\\n\\n222\\n00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,599\\nscenario take place in the 1970s.

It's entirely possible that we\\n\\n229\\n00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,840\\nsee something like this happen today\\n\\n230\\n00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240\\nwhere rising bond yields eventually lead\\n\\n231\\n00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,479\\nto an actual economic slowdown where the\\n\\n232\\n00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319\\nunemployment rate rises and only then\\n\\n233\\n00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,240\\nwould the Federal Reserve react and\\n\\n234\\n00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,919\\nbegin to print money to buy the\\n\\n235\\n00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160\\ngovernment's debt and lower interest\\n\\n236\\n00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,560\\nrates.
